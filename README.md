# Fun Facts!! (Treehouse Android Tutorial)

##### _A basic app that shows random facts upon button clicks_

#### Chris Lytsell

## Description

_An Android app that shows various random facts when a user presses a button. The background color changes as well, but is different with every fact. There is a corresponding image that matches an aspect of the fact that appears/disappears when the user presses the 'floating action button.' For now, this repo is strictly for version control. I am working on expanding the features of the app, mainly to find out all the things that are possible with android apps. But hey who knows, maybe I can get it 'cute' enough to put up on Google Play. :-)_

## Setup
```
I guess if you have a running version of Android SDK you could download the project folder and it should work. If you've got a running emulator, then you are 99% on your way to getting anything to work, so this project would probably fire up just fine!
```

## Technologies Used
